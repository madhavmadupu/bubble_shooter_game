### 📌 Project Title:

**Bubble Shooter – A Color-Matching Game Using Python and Pygame**

___

### 📄 Project Description:

This mini project is a desktop-based arcade game titled **“Bubble Shooter”**, developed using **Python and the Pygame library**. The project simulates a classic bubble shooter game where players aim and shoot colored bubbles to form groups of three or more of the same color, causing them to pop and earn points. The objective is to clear the screen of all bubbles before they reach the bottom.

___

### 🎯 Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate fundamental **game development concepts** using Pygame such as sprite rendering, collision detection, angle-based movement, animation, event handling, and game loop management.

___

### 🧩 Key Features:

-   🎮 **Interactive Gameplay**: The player controls an arrow using arrow keys and shoots bubbles using the spacebar.
    
-   🧠 **Angle-Based Physics**: Bubble movement is calculated based on the angle of the arrow using trigonometric functions.
    
-   💥 **Matching & Popping Mechanism**: Bubbles pop when three or more of the same color connect.
    
-   🔊 **Sound Effects & Background Music**: Enhances the player experience.
    
-   🏁 **Win/Lose Conditions**: The player wins by clearing all bubbles or loses if bubbles reach the bottom.
    
-   📈 **Score Tracking**: Real-time score is calculated based on bubbles popped.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:

-   **Language**: Python 3
    
-   **Library**: Pygame (for graphics, event handling, and audio)
    
-   **Tools**: Pygame.gfxdraw for smooth circular bubble rendering
    

___

### 📌 Concepts Implemented:

-   Sprite classes for the arrow and bubbles
    
-   Collision detection using Pygame’s `sprite.collide_rect`
    
-   Dynamic 2D array to manage the bubble grid
    
-   Recursive DFS algorithm for popping connected bubbles
    
-   Music looping and sound effects with `pygame.mixer`
    
-   Game loop and screen update logic at a constant FPS
    

___

### 🏁 Learning Outcomes:

-   Strengthened understanding of game architecture and logic in Python
    
-   Hands-on experience with sprite-based graphics and animation
    
-   Gained practical knowledge of recursion, collision handling, and real-time interaction in games
